## Project summary (<300 words)
The aim of our project was to engineer a robust Saccharomyces cerevisiae cell factory for the efficient and sustainable production of Î²-farnesene. This sesquiterpene compound holds significant industrial value due to its applications in biofuels, cosmetics, lubricants, and pharmaceuticals. The traditional methods of obtaining Î²-farnesene, such as chemical synthesis and extraction from plant material, are energy-intensive, environmentally unfriendly, and economically impractical due to low yields and susceptibility to climate conditions.

In our work we employed computational tools and analyses to optimize the production capabilities of S. cerevisiae. The first step in the experimental approach was the integration of a heterologous Î²-farnesene synthase from Artemisia annua into the yeast strain EGY48. Additionally, we investigated the impact of media composition, focusing on mimicking YPD media to enhance growth rates and productivity. The findings highlight substantial improvements in growth rate, productivity, and theoretical yield when comparing minimal to YPD (complex) media. 

In order to increase Î²-farnesene production, we manually simulated five popular and well established metabolic enginering strategies. Despite their widespread usage, the impact that those had in the production of Î²-farnesene was minimal. Through flux variability scanning, we identified potential gene targets for upregulation, by comparing them with literature-supported enhancements in terpenoid production. The investigation into the interplay between growth, oxygen availability, and Î²-farnesene production unveils crucial insights, including the linear negative correlation between growth and Î²-farnesene production and the optimal oxygen uptake rate for maximum production. Fianlly, cofactor swap optimization revealed no targets for optimizing Î²-farnesene production. 

In summary, the project successfully employs metabolic engineering strategies, media optimization, and computational analyses to significantly improve the efficiency of Î²-farnesene production in S. cerevisiae. The identified gene targets and the understanding of growth and oxygen uptake dynamics contribute valuable knowledge for the development of high-performing S. sereviciae cell factories.
